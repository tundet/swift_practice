# L4.3: BMI calculator
Create an application where the UI consists of a
UIPickerView (for selecting user height and weight) and
a UITextField (for inputting user name). The app shows
user BMI (based on selected height and weight) with one
decimal accuracy in a UILabel. 
Use the Human class you have earlier developed in
this application. 
Note: populate the picker view dynamically, ie. not from
an array. Define max and min height and weight, and
generate picker view dimensions and content based on
those.
